    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p text-align: justify>In the big picture of my life, I'm all about creating a sweet setup for myself and my fam â€“ you know, the good life. I wanna be in a spot where I can throw a lifeline to others when I've got the means. But, above all, I'm on this journey to figure out what the heck I'm really here for, my true purpose.<br>
        I want to be in a place where I can explore different countries without worrying about the bill. No budget constraints, just soaking up the world. Oh, and besides all that deep stuff, I'm all about the arts. I love painting, designing, and making tunes, my escape from reality.</p>
